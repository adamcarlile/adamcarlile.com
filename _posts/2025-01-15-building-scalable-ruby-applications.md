Ruby has been a cornerstone of web development for over two decades. While it's often criticized for performance, with the right architectural decisions and optimizations, Ruby applications can scale to serve millions of users.

## Key Principles for Scalable Ruby Apps

### 1. Database Optimization
- Use appropriate indexes
- Implement proper query optimization
- Consider read replicas for heavy read workloads

### 2. Caching Strategies
- Redis for session storage
- Fragment caching for expensive views
- HTTP caching with proper headers

### 3. Background Processing
- Use Sidekiq for asynchronous jobs
- Implement proper error handling and retries
- Monitor queue sizes and processing times

## Conclusion

Building scalable Ruby applications requires thoughtful architecture and continuous optimization. The key is to measure, optimize, and iterate based on real-world usage patterns.
