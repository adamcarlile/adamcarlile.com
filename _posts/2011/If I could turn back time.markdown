title: If I could turn back TIME

Time, we can all agree, is an incredibly useful concept, unfortunately the
recent decision to drop `<time>` from the HTML5 spec is not useful.

After all every website that I've recently developed has made use of the
`<time>` element, inside `<article>`, making publish dates something that hold
semantic meaning in relation to the `<article>` in question.

The decision to remove it has been wholeheartedly rejected by the developer
community.

Along with a new website,
[http://whynotime.com/](http://whynotime.com/), and a
trending hashtag [#occupyhtml5](https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23occupyhtml5)

Github and Twitter both use the `<time>` tag extensively, it seems to me to be
incredibly short sighted to remove such a useful element and replace it with
something vague and totally meaningless, `<data>`. `<data>` can contain anything,
and has no meaning to the `<article>` in question.

It seams like a real step backwards to the days of endless `<div>` and `<span>`
elements, except this time endless `<data>` elements with all sorts of
meaningless data within, holding no semantic value whatsoever.

I can only hope that the W3C reverse this decision for the good of the HTML5
spec.
