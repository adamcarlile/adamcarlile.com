Microservices have become the default architecture for many modern applications. However, the distributed nature of microservices introduces complexity that requires careful consideration of architectural patterns.

## Service Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication
- **API Gateway** - Single entry point for clients
- **Service Mesh** - Network layer for service-to-service communication
- **Circuit Breaker** - Prevent cascade failures

### Asynchronous Communication
- **Event Sourcing** - Capture state changes as events
- **Message Queues** - Decouple services with reliable messaging
- **Publish/Subscribe** - Broadcast events to multiple consumers

## Data Management Patterns

### Database per Service
Each microservice owns its data and schema:

```ruby
class UserService
  def create_user(user_data)
    # User service manages user data
    user = User.create(user_data)
    publish_event(:user_created, user)
  end
end
```

### Saga Pattern
Manage distributed transactions across services:

- **Choreography** - Each service knows what to do
- **Orchestration** - Central coordinator manages the flow

## Resilience Patterns

### Circuit Breaker
Prevent failure propagation:

```ruby
class PaymentService
  include CircuitBreaker

  circuit_breaker :process_payment, timeout: 5.seconds

  def process_payment(amount)
    # Payment processing logic
  end
end
```

### Bulkhead Pattern
Isolate critical resources:

- Separate thread pools for different operations
- Resource partitioning
- Service isolation

## Monitoring and Observability

Distributed systems require comprehensive monitoring:

- **Distributed Tracing** - Follow requests across services
- **Centralized Logging** - Aggregate logs from all services
- **Health Checks** - Monitor service availability

Microservices aren't a silver bullet, but with the right patterns and practices, they can provide the scalability and flexibility that modern applications require.
